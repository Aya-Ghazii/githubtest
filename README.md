# githubtest - Simple HTML Project

This is a simple HTML project that displays a "Hello, World!" message on the webpage.



## Features

- Displays a "Hello, World!" message.
- Simple and easy-to-understand code structure.

## Installation

To use this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:  
   First, you need to clone the repository to your local machine. Run the following command in your terminal:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Aya-Ghazii/githubtest.git



### Key Improvements:

1. **Headings**: The `##` before "Preview", "Features", etc., ensures they are treated as subheadings. This helps organize the content.
2. **Code Block**: The `git clone` command is inside a code block, making it easier to read and copy.
3. **Usage Section**: I added a `Usage` section to explain what the project does and how to use it.
4. **Contributing Section**: The standard contributing instructions were added, which are helpful if others plan to collaborate on the project.
5. **License Section**: The MIT license section remains, which is commonly used for open-source projects.

### Additional Suggestions:

- **LICENSE File**: If you don't have a LICENSE file yet, you can create one or remove that section if not applicable.

This version should be easier to follow and looks more polished for anyone browsing the repository on GitHub. Let me know if you need further adjustments!
